  /**
   * Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving
   * as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare
   * in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When
   * implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge
   * sort and heapsort.
   *
   * Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a
   * "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. In efficient implementations it is
   * not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.
   * Quicksort can operate in-place on an array, requiring small additional amounts of memory to
   * perform the sorting.
   *
   * Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes O(n log n)
   * comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes O(n2) comparisons, though this
   * behavior is rare.
