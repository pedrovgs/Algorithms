   *
   * First, we are going to find the first number witch square is greater than the number. Once we
   * have that number we are going to apply a binary search between candidate and candidate +1.
   *
   * The complexity order in space terms of this algorithm is O(1) because we are not using any
   * additional data structure. The complexity order in time terms is more difficult to calculate
   * T(N) = T(N/2) + c  where as N is step length. Which is 1 initially. 0.5 after that. 0.25 after that
   * Stopping condition of this recurrence relation is dependant on delta. If it is 0, then time complexity is infinite
   * So we won't be able to calculate the exact time complexity using master's theorem.
   * Time complexity of this algorithm is inversly proportional to square root of Delta
   * As square root is an irrational number for non square numbers.
   * But here, it will be function of delta and precision of the variables used. Which is difficult to calculate.
