 * In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following

 *
 * 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34.
 *
 * The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs
 * connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling;this one uses squares of
 * sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.
 * By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, or 0 and 1,
 * depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of
 * the previous two.
 *
 * Can you write a method to calculate the Nth Fibonacci number?
