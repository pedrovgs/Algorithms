   * Implementation of a tail recursive flood fill algorithm to solve this problem. Flood fill,
   * also called seed fill, is an algorithm that determines the area connected to a given node in a
   * multi-dimensional array. It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill
   * connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and
   * Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared. When applied on an image to fill a
   * particular bounded area with color, it is also known as boundary fill.
   *
   * The complexity order of this algorithm in space terms is O(1) because we are not using any
   * additional data structure to store data temporally. In time termsn the complexity order is
   * O(N) where N is the number of pixels to change color.
